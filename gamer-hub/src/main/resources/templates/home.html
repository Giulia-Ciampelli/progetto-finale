                            As an admin, you hold the keys to the vault. You’re responsible for keeping the database
                            clean, complete, and useful. Here’s what you can do: <br>
                            - Create new games, complete with images, descriptions, platform lists, tags, and pricing
                            info. <br>
                            - Edit existing games to keep details up-to-date or refine game metadata. <br>
                            - Delete games that are no longer relevant or mistakenly added. <br>
                            - Manage tags and platforms used across the site. <br>
                            Your role ensures the platform stays curated, flexible, and ready to scale with your growing
                            collection.
